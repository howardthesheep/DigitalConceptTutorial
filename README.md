# Setting up Linux Mint and Windows Dual Boot

## **By Parker Jones**

## Introduction
Dual booting is a common practice now a days and its important to know how to utilize it. This is mainly useful to those who are programmers and developers. Linux provides a better environment for programming and web coding (eg. LAMP stack). Linux is especially good at providing an easy to use C/C++ coding environment (in my personal experience). Now knowing some of the basic pros of Linux, I'm going to walk through the steps in order to dual boot both operating systems on your computer. You can also boot from a flash drive if you prefer to not mess with your HDD/SDD partitions, but I have found dual booting to be the preferred method. 

## Target Audience
This tutorial is not terribly difficult, however, it can lead to some unintended consequences if steps aren't followed correctly. That being said I highly suggest you keep a backup of your files and a windows install disk in the event that you accidently wipe a partition that you were using for windows. With those pitfalls, I wouldn't recommend this tutorial to anyone who doesn't have atleast 1-2 years experience of working with/on computers.
